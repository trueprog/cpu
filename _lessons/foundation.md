Programming languages can be divided into three categories by the way they are
executed:

Machine languages
: The CPU can directly execute those. Each CPU type has their own version of
machine language.

Compiled languages
: Programs in these language are translated or *compiled* into machine language
first and then the result can be executed. Examples are C, C++, and Fortran.

Interpreted languages
: Programs in these language are run by another program, the *interpreter*, that
takes each line of code and executes some corresponding machine language for it.
Examples are JavaScript, Python and BASIC.

Java is actually a mix: It is first compiled by `javac` to an intermediate
language, the *Java byte code*, which is then interpreted by `java`, the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
