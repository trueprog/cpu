To really understand computer programming, first you need to understand how
computers work. Now, a modern computer is a complex machine. To make things 
easier, we'll have a look at the first microcomputers. They were first sold
in the 1970s, almost 50 years ago. However, on the
architecture level, these were already similar to the computer you're using
right now.
